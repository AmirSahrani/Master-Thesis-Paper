\lhead{\emp{Ethics and Data Management}}
A new requirement for the thesis is that there must be a short section in which you reflect on the ethical aspects of your project. This requirement is related to one of the final objectives that a graduated student of the Master of Computational Science must meet: â€œThe graduate of the program has insight into the social significance of Computational Science and the responsibilities of experts in this field within science and in society". You don't need to devote an entire chapter to this; a short section or paragraph is sufficient.

I acknowledge that the thesis adheres to the ethical code (\url{https://student.uva.nl/en/topics/ethics-in-research}) and research data management policies (\url{https://rdm.uva.nl/en}) of UvA and IvI.

The following table lists the data used in this thesis (including source codes). I confirm that the list is complete and the listed data are sufficient to reproduce the results of the thesis. If a prohibitive non-disclosure agreement is in effect at the time of submission ``NDA'' is written under ``Availability'' and ``License'' for the concerned data items.
