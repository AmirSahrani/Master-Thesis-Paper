Though Black's result~\citep{blackRationaleGroupDecisionmaking1948} is a famous positive result, it is far from the only positive result relating to domain restrictions. We first look into various domain restrictions and their properties. To fully understand why single-peakedness is specifically desirable we outline the political and philosophical reasons first, after which we elaborate on the mechanism through which deliberation should result in single-peakedness according to \citet{listTwoConceptsAgreement2002}. Finally, for completeness' sake, we mention critiques of this theory.
