In the model of deliberation of \citet{radDeliberationSinglePeakednessCoherent2021a}, outlined in \cref{section:related_work}, aims to model deliberation, through this the aim is to show deliberation results in nicely structured profiles which allow for strategy proof voting rules. One important caveat, also given by the authors, is that all participants should honestly and truthfully participate in deliberation. We attempt to make this more formal with the following proposition.

\begin{proposition}{}\label{proposition:deterministic-delib}
	% Deliberation on any metric space can be manipulated if all voters can still change their mind (open-minded voters), if one voter decided not to change their mind.
	The process of deliberation over $|\alternatives| \geq 3$ through deterministic deliberation procedure \(\boldsymbol{D}: \setOfStrictProfiles^n \mapsto \setOfStrictProfiles^n\) followed by voting with voting rule $F$ cannot be surjective, strategyproof and non-dictatorial.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}{} 
	Assume, towards a contradiction, such a pair of deliberative procedure ($D$) and voting rule (\(f\)) exists. Any deterministic deliberation procedure $D$ could, in principle, be embedded into a voting rule $f'$, such that the voting rule simulates $D$ and before applying $f$, which would result in  voting rule $f'$ being surjective, strategyproof and non-dictatorial. This is a contradiction, by the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem\citep{gibbardManipulationVotingSchemes1973,satterthwaiteStrategyproofnessArrowsConditions1975}.
\end{proof}


We extend upon this result, showing the inclusion of biases in voters does not mitigate the negative result. Towards this we assume biases are true, in the sense that a voter cannot help but be 'convinced' by the presented profiles as much as their biases allows for this. We think this assumption is a rather weak one, as without this assumption, the biases become an object of strategic behavior, resulting in all voters having a bias of 1 towards their own opinion, reducing to the situation in \cref{proposition:deterministic-delib}.

\begin{corollary}
	\label{corollary:biased-delib}
	Deliberation with biases $\boldsymbol{D}_b: \setOfStrictProfiles ^ n \times \Reals_{[0,1]}^n \mapsto \setOfStrictProfiles^n$, followed by voting with voting rule any $F$, cannot be surjective, strategyproof and non-dictatorial
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}{} 
	The proof will follow from a reduction of the biased Deliberation $\boldsymbol{D}_b$ to general deliberation $\boldsymbol{D}$. 

	Take any election consisting of biased deliberation $D_b$ and voting rule $f$, since biases $\bold{b}$ are true, they must be fixed. If this election was immune to strategic manipulation, then a deliberative procedure $D$ could embed this $b$, and simulate biased deliberation $D_b$. This is now equivalent to the setting in \cref{proposition:deterministic-delib}, and thus suffers the same impossibility result.

	
\end{proof}
