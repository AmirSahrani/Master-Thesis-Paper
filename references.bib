	                voting and majority rule, representation, courts and

	                rejecting them for more direct democracy. Third, these

	                restricting the spectrum of individual preferences in a
	                sensible way. Gaertner’s starting point is K. J. Arrow’s
	                famous “Impossibility Theorem”, which showed that no
	                welfare function could exist if an unrestricted domain of

	                appealing conditions. A number of leading economists have
	                tried to provide avenues out of this “impossibility” by
	                restricting the variety of preferences: here, Gaertner
	                provides a clear and detailed account, using standardized
	                mathematical notation, of well over forty theorems

	abstractNote = {This chapter discusses different types of domain
	                restrictions. We begin by analyzing various qualitative
	                conditions on preference profiles. Value-restricted
	                preferences (with single-peaked preferences as one of its
	                subcases), limited agreement as well as antagonistic and
	                dichotomous preferences are relatively easy to interpret.
	                In our view, the property of single-peakedness stands out
	                in particular. It proves to be a central restriction
	                under majority voting. However, it also plays an
	                essential role in the context of strategy-proof voting
	                rules (which is the topic of another chapter in this
	                Handbook). Furthermore, we consider quantitative or
	                number-specific requirements on the distribution of
	                voters over different preference orderings, and we shall
	                see that some of those requirements are logically related
	                to the qualitative conditions such as extremal
	                restriction and value-restricted preferences. While the
	                latter restrictions are requirements on combinations of
	                individual orderings, the domains of individual orderings
	                that admit n-person nondictatorial social welfare
	                functions à la Arrow result from restrictions on
	                permissible preferences for individuals. While the first
	                five sections study the aggregation problem within the
	                framework of arbitrary finite sets of discrete
	                alternatives, the final section discusses continuous
	                choice rules; the alternatives are assumed to be
	                n-dimensional vectors in Euclidean space. Contractibility
	                as a condition on the topological space of preferences
	                proves to be necessary and sufficient for the existence
	                of continuous aggregation rules.},

	                available alternatives on the political agenda. Some

	                open question is how to measure the distance between any
	                two judgment sets. This is relevant for issues of social
	                choice: if two individuals hold different beliefs then we
	                might want to find a compromise that lies somewhere
	                between them. We propose a set of axioms that determine a
	                measure of distance uniquely. This measure differs from
	                the widely used Hamming metric. The difference between
	                Hamming’s metric and ours boils down to one axiom. Given
	                judgment sets A and B, this axiom says that if the
	                propositions in $${A cap B}$$jointly imply that the

	                disagreement between A and B over those propositions in
	                A−B should be counted as a single disagreement. We
	                consider the application of our metric to judgment
	                aggregation, and also use the metric to measure the

	abstractNote = {There are various ways to reach a group decision on a
	                factual yes–no question. One way is to vote and decide
	                what the majority votes for. This procedure receives some
	                epistemological support from the Condorcet Jury Theorem.
	                Alternatively, the group members may prefer to deliberate
	                and will eventually reach a decision that everybody
	                endorses—a consensus. While the latter procedure has the
	                advantage that it makes everybody happy (as everybody
	                endorses the consensus), it has the disadvantage that it
	                is difficult to implement, especially for larger groups.
	                Besides, the resulting consensus may be far away from the
	                truth. And so we ask: Is deliberation truth-conducive in
	                the sense that majority voting is? To address this
	                question, we construct a highly idealized model of a
	                particular deliberation process, inspired by the movie
	                Twelve Angry Men, and show that the answer is ‘yes’.
	                Deliberation procedures can be truth-conducive just as
	                the voting procedure is. We then explore, again on the
	                basis of our model and using agent-based simulations,
	                under which conditions it is better epistemically to
	                deliberate than to vote. Our analysis shows that there
	                are contexts in which deliberation is epistemically
	                preferable and we will provide reasons for why this is
	                so.},

	abstractNote = {Rational deliberation helps to avoid cyclic or
	                intransitive group preferences by fostering
	                meta-agreements, which in turn ensures single-peaked
	                profiles. This is the received view, but this paper
	                argues that it should be qualified. On one hand we
	                provide evidence from computational simulations that
	                rational deliberation tends to increase proximity to
	                so-called single-plateaued preferences. This evidence is
	                important to the extent that, as we argue, the idea that
	                rational deliberation fosters the creation of
	                meta-agreement and, in turn, single-peaked profiles does
	                not carry over to single-plateaued ones, and the latter
	                but not the former makes coherent aggregation possible
	                when the participants are allowed to express indifference
	                between options. On the other hand, however, our
	                computational results show, against the received view,
	                that when the participants are strongly biased towards
	                their own opinions, rational deliberation tends to create
	                irrational group preferences, instead of eliminating
	                them. These results are independent of whether the
	                participants reach meta-agreements in the process, and as
	                such they highlight the importance of rational preference
	                change and biases towards one’s own opinion in
	                understanding the effects of rational deliberation.},
