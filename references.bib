	                increasingly central in societies characterized by deep
	                disagreements, social problems of enormous complexity and
	                also consider the blunt instruments of available
	                institutions. First, theories of deliberative democracy
	                have come to emphasize the process of deliberation itself
	                , rather than its ideal and counterfactual conditions and
	                procedures. Second, deliberative democrats have become
	                increasingly interested in the problems of
	                institutionalization, of making institutions such as
	                voting and majority rule, representation, courts and
	                constitutional law more deliberative rather than
	                rejecting them for more direct democracy. Third, these
	                aforementioned democrats are concerned with examining and
	                comparing different settings and procedures of

	                how to establish a social welfare function while
	                restricting the spectrum of individual preferences in a
	                sensible way. Gaertner’s starting point is K. J. Arrow’s
	                famous “Impossibility Theorem”, which showed that no
	                welfare function could exist if an unrestricted domain of
	                preferences is to be satisfied together with some other
	                appealing conditions. A number of leading economists have
	                tried to provide avenues out of this “impossibility” by
	                restricting the variety of preferences: here, Gaertner
	                provides a clear and detailed account, using standardized
	                mathematical notation, of well over forty theorems

	abstractNote = {This chapter discusses different types of domain
	                restrictions. We begin by analyzing various qualitative
	                conditions on preference profiles. Value-restricted
	                preferences (with single-peaked preferences as one of its
	                subcases), limited agreement as well as antagonistic and
	                dichotomous preferences are relatively easy to interpret.
	                In our view, the property of single-peakedness stands out
	                in particular. It proves to be a central restriction
	                under majority voting. However, it also plays an
	                essential role in the context of strategy-proof voting
	                rules (which is the topic of another chapter in this
	                Handbook). Furthermore, we consider quantitative or
	                number-specific requirements on the distribution of
	                voters over different preference orderings, and we shall
	                see that some of those requirements are logically related
	                to the qualitative conditions such as extremal
	                restriction and value-restricted preferences. While the
	                latter restrictions are requirements on combinations of
	                individual orderings, the domains of individual orderings
	                that admit n-person nondictatorial social welfare
	                functions à la Arrow result from restrictions on
	                permissible preferences for individuals. While the first
	                five sections study the aggregation problem within the
	                framework of arbitrary finite sets of discrete
	                alternatives, the final section discusses continuous
	                choice rules; the alternatives are assumed to be
	                n-dimensional vectors in Euclidean space. Contractibility
	                as a condition on the topological space of preferences
	                proves to be necessary and sufficient for the existence
	                of continuous aggregation rules.},

	                available alternatives on the political agenda. Some
