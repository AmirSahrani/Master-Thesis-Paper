              deliberative democracy have changed in light of practical concerns

              characterized by deep disagreements, social problems of enormous
              complexity and also consider the blunt instruments of available
              institutions. First, theories of deliberative democracy have come
              to emphasize the process of deliberation itself, rather than its
              ideal and counterfactual conditions and procedures. Second,
              deliberative democrats have become increasingly interested in the
              problems of institutionalization, of making institutions such as
              voting and majority rule, representation, courts and constitutional
              law more deliberative rather than rejecting them for more direct
              democracy. Third, these aforementioned democrats are concerned with
              examining and comparing different settings and procedures of
              deliberation, pointing out empirical problems and obstacles that
              cannot always be anticipated by conceptual argument alone.},

              participants in the American Life Panel (ALP). Each described a

              measuring candidate preference, closeness of the election, and the

              question is how to measure the distance between any two judgment
              sets. This is relevant for issues of social choice: if two
              individuals hold different beliefs then we might want to find a
              compromise that lies somewhere between them. We propose a set of
              axioms that determine a measure of distance uniquely. This measure
              differs from the widely used Hamming metric. The difference between
              Hamming's metric and ours boils down to one axiom. Given judgment
              sets A and B, this axiom says that if the propositions in A {$\cap$
              } B jointly imply that the propositions in A --- B share the same
              truth value, then the disagreement between A and B over those
              propositions in A --- B should be counted as a single disagreement.
              We consider the application of our metric to judgment aggregation,
              and also use the metric to measure the distance between preference
              rankings.},

              democratic system more specifically. I shall first look at social
              choice theory, as an instance of a wider class of theories with
              certain common features. In particular, they share the conception
              that the political process is instrumental rather than an end in
              itself, and the view that the decisive political act is a private
              rather than a public action, viz. the individual and secret vote.
              With these usually goes the idea that the goal of politics is the
              optimal compromise between given, and irreducibly opposed, private
              interests. The other two views arise when one denies, first, the
              private character of political behaviour and then, secondly, goes
              on also to deny the instrumental nature of politics. According to
              the theory of J{\"u}rgen Habermas, the goal of politics should be
              rational agreement rather than compromise, and the decisive
              political act is that of engaging in public debate with a view to
              the emergence of a consensus. According to the theorists of
              participatory democracy, from John Stuart Mill to Carole Pateman,
              the goal of politics is the transformation and education of the
              participants. Politics, on this view, is an end in itself -- indeed
              many have argued that it represents the good life for man. I shall
              discuss these views in the order indicated. I shall present them in
              a somewhat stylized form, but my critical comments will not I hope,

              changing the outcome of an election. Many voting systems are, in
              the general case, computationally resistant to some of these
              manipulative actions. However when restricted to single-peaked
              electorates, these systems suddenly become easy to manipulate.
              Recently, Faliszewski, Hemaspaandra, and Hemaspaandra studied the
              complexity of dishonest behavior in nearly single-peaked
              electorates. These are electorates that are not single-peaked but
              close to it according to some distance measure. In this paper we
              introduce several new distance measures regarding
              single-peakedness. We prove that determining whether a given
              profile is nearly single-peaked is NP-complete in many cases. For
              one case we present a polynomial-time algorithm. Furthermore, we

              This article accounts for these differences by showing how

              deliberate in depth over a long weekend on five major issues facing
              the country. A pre--post control group was also asked the same
              questions. The deliberators showed large, depolarizing changes in
              their policy attitudes and large decreases in affective
              polarization. The paper develops the rationale for hypotheses
              explaining these decreases and contrasts them with a literature
              that would have expected the opposite. The paper briefly concludes
              with a discussion of how elements of this ``antidote'' can be
              scaled.},

              complex issue within social choice theory: how to establish a
              social welfare function while restricting the spectrum of
              individual preferences in a sensible way. Gaertner's starting point
              is K. J. Arrow's famous 'Impossibility Theorem', which showed that
              no welfare function could exist if an unrestricted domain of
              preferences is to be satisfied together with some other appealing
              conditions. A number of leading economists have tried to provide
              avenues out of this 'impossibility' by restricting the variety of
              preferences: here, Gaertner provides a clear and detailed account,
              using standardized mathematical notation, of well over forty
              theorems associated with domain conditions. Domain Conditions in
              Social Choice Theory will be an essential addition to the library
              of social choice theory for scholars and their advanced graduate

  abstract = {This chapter discusses different types of domain restrictions. We
              begin by analyzing various qualitative conditions on preference
              profiles. Value-restricted preferences (with single-peaked
              preferences as one of its subcases), limited agreement as well as
              antagonistic and dichotomous preferences are relatively easy to
              interpret. In our view, the property of single-peakedness stands
              out in particular. It proves to be a central restriction under
              majority voting. However, it also plays an essential role in the
              context of strategy-proof voting rules (which is the topic of
              another chapter in this Handbook). Furthermore, we consider
              quantitative or number-specific requirements on the distribution of
              voters over different preference orderings, and we shall see that
              some of those requirements are logically related to the qualitative
              conditions such as extremal restriction and value-restricted
              preferences. While the latter restrictions are requirements on
              combinations of individual orderings, the domains of individual
              orderings that admit n-person nondictatorial social welfare
              functions {\`a} la Arrow result from restrictions on permissible
              preferences for individuals. While the first five sections study
              the aggregation problem within the framework of arbitrary finite
              sets of discrete alternatives, the final section discusses
              continuous choice rules; the alternatives are assumed to be
              n-dimensional vectors in Euclidean space. Contractibility as a
              condition on the topological space of preferences proves to be
              necessary and sufficient for the existence of continuous
              aggregation rules.},

              yes--no question. One way is to vote and decide what the majority
              votes for. This procedure receives some epistemological support
              from the Condorcet Jury Theorem. Alternatively, the group members
              may prefer to deliberate and will eventually reach a decision that
              everybody endorses---a consensus. While the latter procedure has
              the advantage that it makes everybody happy (as everybody endorses
              the consensus), it has the disadvantage that it is difficult to
              implement, especially for larger groups. Besides, the resulting
              consensus may be far away from the truth. And so we ask: Is
              deliberation truth-conducive in the sense that majority voting is?
              To address this question, we construct a highly idealized model of
              a particular deliberation process, inspired by the movie Twelve
              Angry Men, and show that the answer is `yes'. Deliberation
              procedures can be truth-conducive just as the voting procedure is.
              We then explore, again on the basis of our model and using
              agent-based simulations, under which conditions it is better
              epistemically to deliberate than to vote. Our analysis shows that
              there are contexts in which deliberation is epistemically
              preferable and we will provide reasons for why this is so.},

              which the issues at stake are `conceptualized'. We argue here that

              preferences by fostering meta-agreements, which in turn ensures
              single-peaked profiles. This is the received view, but this paper
              argues that it should be qualified. On one hand we provide evidence
              from computational simulations that rational deliberation tends to
              increase proximity to so-called single-plateaued preferences. This
              evidence is important to the extent that, as we argue, the idea
              that rational deliberation fosters the creation of meta-agreement
              and, in turn, single-peaked profiles does not carry over to
              single-plateaued ones, and the latter but not the former makes
              coherent aggregation possible when the participants are allowed to
              express indifference between options. On the other hand, however,
              our computational results show, against the received view, that
              when the participants are strongly biased towards their own
              opinions, rational deliberation tends to create irrational group
              preferences, instead of eliminating them. These results are
              independent of whether the participants reach meta-agreements in
              the process, and as such they highlight the importance of rational
              preference change and biases towards one's own opinion in
