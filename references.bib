  abstract = {Network sampling is integral to the analysis of social,
              information, and biological networks. Since many real-world
              networks are massive in size, continuously evolving, and/or
              distributed in nature, the network structure is often sampled in
              order to facilitate study. For these reasons, a more thorough and
              complete understanding of network sampling is critical to support
              the field of network science. In this paper, we outline a framework
              for the general problem of network sampling by highlighting the
              different objectives, population and units of interest, and classes
              of network sampling methods. In addition, we propose a spectrum of
              computational models for network sampling methods, ranging from the
              traditionally studied model based on the assumption of a static
              domain to a more challenging model that is appropriate for
              streaming domains. We design a family of sampling methods based on
              the concept of graph induction that generalize across the full
              spectrum of computational models (from static to streaming) while
              efficiently preserving many of the topological properties of the
              input graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate how traditional static
              sampling algorithms can be modified for graph streams for each of
              the three main classes of sampling methods: node, edge, and
              topology-based sampling. Experimental results indicate that our
              proposed family of sampling methods more accurately preserve the
              underlying properties of the graph in both static and streaming
              domains. Finally, we study the impact of network sampling
              algorithms on the parameter estimation and performance evaluation
              of relational classification algorithms.},

              law more deliberative rather than rejecting them for more direct
              democracy. Third, these aforementioned democrats are concerned with
              examining and comparing different settings and procedures of

              question is how to measure the distance between any two judgment
              sets. This is relevant for issues of social choice: if two
              individuals hold different beliefs then we might want to find a
              compromise that lies somewhere between them. We propose a set of
              axioms that determine a measure of distance uniquely. This measure
              differs from the widely used Hamming metric. The difference between
              Hamming's metric and ours boils down to one axiom. Given judgment
              sets A and B, this axiom says that if the propositions in A {$\cap$
              } B jointly imply that the propositions in A --- B share the same
              truth value, then the disagreement between A and B over those
              propositions in A --- B should be counted as a single disagreement.
              We consider the application of our metric to judgment aggregation,
              and also use the metric to measure the distance between preference
              rankings.},

              choice theory, as an instance of a wider class of theories with
              certain common features. In particular, they share the conception
              that the political process is instrumental rather than an end in
              itself, and the view that the decisive political act is a private
              rather than a public action, viz. the individual and secret vote.
              With these usually goes the idea that the goal of politics is the
              optimal compromise between given, and irreducibly opposed, private
              interests. The other two views arise when one denies, first, the
              private character of political behaviour and then, secondly, goes
              on also to deny the instrumental nature of politics. According to
              the theory of J{\"u}rgen Habermas, the goal of politics should be
              rational agreement rather than compromise, and the decisive
              political act is that of engaging in public debate with a view to
              the emergence of a consensus. According to the theorists of
              participatory democracy, from John Stuart Mill to Carole Pateman,
              the goal of politics is the transformation and education of the
              participants. Politics, on this view, is an end in itself -- indeed
              many have argued that it represents the good life for man. I shall
              discuss these views in the order indicated. I shall present them in
              a somewhat stylized form, but my critical comments will not I hope,
              be directed to strawmen.},

              Recently, Faliszewski, Hemaspaandra, and Hemaspaandra studied the
              complexity of dishonest behavior in nearly single-peaked
              electorates. These are electorates that are not single-peaked but
              close to it according to some distance measure. In this paper we
              introduce several new distance measures regarding
              single-peakedness. We prove that determining whether a given
              profile is nearly single-peaked is NP-complete in many cases. For
              one case we present a polynomial-time algorithm. Furthermore, we
              explore the relations between several notions of nearly
              single-peakedness.},

              Room'' was a national field experiment in which more than 500
              randomly selected registered voters were brought from all over the
              country to deliberate on five major issues facing the country. A
              pre-post control group was also surveyed on the same questions
              after the weekend and about a year later. There were significant
              differences in voting intention and in actual voting behavior a
              year later among the deliberators compared to the control group.
              This article accounts for these differences by showing how
              deliberation stimulated a latent variable of political engagement.
              If deliberation has lasting effects on political engagement, then
              it provides a rationale for attempts to scale the deliberative
              process to much larger numbers. The article considers methods for
              doing so in the context of the broader debate about mini-publics,

              non-deliberative society.},

              individual preferences in a sensible way. Gaertner's starting point
              is K. J. Arrow's famous 'Impossibility Theorem', which showed that
              no welfare function could exist if an unrestricted domain of
              preferences is to be satisfied together with some other appealing
              conditions. A number of leading economists have tried to provide
              avenues out of this 'impossibility' by restricting the variety of
              preferences: here, Gaertner provides a clear and detailed account,
              using standardized mathematical notation, of well over forty
              theorems associated with domain conditions. Domain Conditions in
              Social Choice Theory will be an essential addition to the library

  abstract = {This chapter discusses different types of domain restrictions. We
              begin by analyzing various qualitative conditions on preference
              profiles. Value-restricted preferences (with single-peaked
              preferences as one of its subcases), limited agreement as well as
              antagonistic and dichotomous preferences are relatively easy to
              interpret. In our view, the property of single-peakedness stands
              out in particular. It proves to be a central restriction under
              majority voting. However, it also plays an essential role in the
              context of strategy-proof voting rules (which is the topic of
              another chapter in this Handbook). Furthermore, we consider
              quantitative or number-specific requirements on the distribution of
              voters over different preference orderings, and we shall see that
              some of those requirements are logically related to the qualitative
              conditions such as extremal restriction and value-restricted
              preferences. While the latter restrictions are requirements on
              combinations of individual orderings, the domains of individual
              orderings that admit n-person nondictatorial social welfare
              functions {\`a} la Arrow result from restrictions on permissible
              preferences for individuals. While the first five sections study
              the aggregation problem within the framework of arbitrary finite
              sets of discrete alternatives, the final section discusses
              continuous choice rules; the alternatives are assumed to be
              n-dimensional vectors in Euclidean space. Contractibility as a
              condition on the topological space of preferences proves to be
              necessary and sufficient for the existence of continuous
              aggregation rules.},

              yes--no question. One way is to vote and decide what the majority
              votes for. This procedure receives some epistemological support
              from the Condorcet Jury Theorem. Alternatively, the group members
              may prefer to deliberate and will eventually reach a decision that
              everybody endorses---a consensus. While the latter procedure has
              the advantage that it makes everybody happy (as everybody endorses
              the consensus), it has the disadvantage that it is difficult to
              implement, especially for larger groups. Besides, the resulting
              consensus may be far away from the truth. And so we ask: Is
              deliberation truth-conducive in the sense that majority voting is?
              To address this question, we construct a highly idealized model of
              a particular deliberation process, inspired by the movie Twelve
              Angry Men, and show that the answer is `yes'. Deliberation
              procedures can be truth-conducive just as the voting procedure is.
              We then explore, again on the basis of our model and using
              agent-based simulations, under which conditions it is better
              epistemically to deliberate than to vote. Our analysis shows that
              there are contexts in which deliberation is epistemically
              preferable and we will provide reasons for why this is so.},

              several of them become impractical for large graphs. Thus graph
              sampling is essential.The natural questions to ask are (a) which
              sampling method to use, (b) how small can the sample size be, and
              (c) how to scale up the measurements of the sample (e.g., the

              underlying question is subtle: how do we measure success?.We answer
              the above questions, and test our answers by thorough experiments

  abstract = {Graph processing has become a topic of interest in many domains.
              However, we still observe a lack of representative datasets for
              in-depth performance and scalability analysis. Neither data
              collections, nor graph generators provide enough diversity and
              control for thorough analysis. To address this problem, we proposea
              heuristic method for scaling existing graphs. Our approach, based
              onsampling andinterconnection, can provide a scaled "version" of a
              given graph. Moreover, we provide analytical models to predict the
              topological properties of the scaled graphs (such as the diameter,
              degree distribution, density, or the clustering coefficient), and
              further enable the user to tweak these properties. Property control
              is achieved through a portfolio of graph interconnection methods
              (e.g., star, ring, chain, fully connected) applied for combining
              the graph samples. We further implement our method as an
              open-source tool which can be used to quickly provide families of
              datasets for in-depth benchmarking of graph processing algorithms.
              Our empirical evaluation demonstrates our tool provides scaled
              graphs of a wide range of sizes, whose properties match well with
              model predictions and/or user requirements. Finally, we also
              illustrate, through a case-study, how scaled graphs can be used for
              in-depth performance analysis of graph processing algorithms.},

              voting, by promoting consensus on the available alternatives on the
              political agenda. Some critics have argued that full consensus is
              too demanding and inimical to pluralism and have pointed out that
              single-peakedness, a much less stringent condition, is sufficient
              to overcome voting paradoxes. According to these accounts,
              deliberation can induce single-peakedness through the creation of a
              `meta-agreement', that is, agreement on the dimension according to
              which the issues at stake are `conceptualized'. We argue here that
              once all the conditions needed for deliberation to bring about
              single-peakedness through meta-agreement are unpacked and made
              explicit, meta-agreement turns out to be a highly demanding
              condition, and one that is very inhospitable to pluralism.},

              preferences by fostering meta-agreements, which in turn ensures
              single-peaked profiles. This is the received view, but this paper
              argues that it should be qualified. On one hand we provide evidence
              from computational simulations that rational deliberation tends to
              increase proximity to so-called single-plateaued preferences. This
              evidence is important to the extent that, as we argue, the idea
              that rational deliberation fosters the creation of meta-agreement
              and, in turn, single-peaked profiles does not carry over to
              single-plateaued ones, and the latter but not the former makes
              coherent aggregation possible when the participants are allowed to
              express indifference between options. On the other hand, however,
              our computational results show, against the received view, that
              when the participants are strongly biased towards their own
              opinions, rational deliberation tends to create irrational group
              preferences, instead of eliminating them. These results are
              independent of whether the participants reach meta-agreements in
              the process, and as such they highlight the importance of rational
              preference change and biases towards one's own opinion in
              understanding the effects of rational deliberation.},

              specific, we embed two types of calibration modules in the graph
              matching, which model the correspondence relationship in point and
              edge respectively. The point calibration module performs unary
              alignment over points and the edge calibration module performs
              local structure alignment over edges. By performing the dual
              calibration, the feature points correspondence between two images
              with deformations and rotations variations can be obtained. To
              enhance the robustness of correspondence establishment, the L2,
              p-norm is employed as the similarity metric in the proposed model,
              which is a flexible metric due to setting the different p values.
              Finally, we incorporate the dual calibration and L2,p-norm based
              similarity metric into the graph matching model which can be
              optimized by an effective algorithm, and theoretically prove the
              convergence of the presented algorithm. Experimental results in the
              variety of graph matching tasks such as deformations, rotations and
              outliers evidence the competitive performance of the presented DCM
              model over the state-of-theart approaches.},

  abstract = {Quadratic assignment problems arise in a wide variety of domains,
              spanning operations research, graph theory, computer vision, and
              neuroscience, to name a few. The graph matching problem is a
              special case of the quadratic assignment problem, and graph
              matching is increasingly important as graph-valued data is becoming
              more prominent. With the aim of efficiently and accurately matching
              the large graphs common in big data, we present our graph matching
              algorithm, the Fast Approximate Quadratic assignment algorithm. We
              empirically demonstrate that our algorithm is faster and achieves a
              lower objective value on over 80\% of the QAPLIB benchmark library,
              compared with the previous state-of-the-art. Applying our algorithm
              to our motivating example, matching C. elegans connectomes
              (brain-graphs), we find that it efficiently achieves performance.},
